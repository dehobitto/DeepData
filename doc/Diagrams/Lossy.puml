title DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) Method

participant "JPEG Image" as Image
participant "Data" as Data
participant "DCT Method" as DCT

Data -> DCT: Input data bits
activate DCT
Image -> DCT: Input JPEG image

DCT -> DCT: Decompress JPEG to DCT coefficients
DCT -> DCT: Process each 8x8 block

alt Embedding
    DCT -> DCT: Check capacity
    DCT -> DCT: Modify DCT coefficients\nusing QIM-like approach
    DCT -> DCT: Skip zero coefficients
    DCT -> Image: Compress modified coefficients\nto JPEG
else Extraction
    DCT -> DCT: Read header
    DCT -> DCT: Extract data from\nDCT coefficients
    DCT -> DCT: Skip zero coefficients
    DCT -> Data: Save as file
end

deactivate DCT
