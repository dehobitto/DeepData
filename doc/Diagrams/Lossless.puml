participant "Image" as Image
participant "Data" as Data
participant "Method" as Method

Data -> Method: Input data bits
Image -> Method: Input image pixels

alt LSB Method
    Method -> Method: Process each byte
    Method -> Method: Replace N least significant bits\nwith data bits (N = strength)
else QIM Method
    Method -> Method: Process each pixel channel
    Method -> Method: Quantize value to nearest\nrepresentative value based on bit
end

Method -> Image: Modified image

Image -> Method: Input stego-image

alt LSB Method
    Method -> Method: Process each byte
    Method -> Method: Extract N least significant bits
else QIM Method
    Method -> Method: Process each pixel channel
    Method -> Method: Determine which representative\nvalue is closest
end

Method -> Data: Reconstructed data bits
